# Research Findings: Maverick Spend Analysis and Concentration Metrics

## Key Findings So Far:

### 1. SpendQube Maverick Spend Analysis
- **Tool Purpose:** Gain instant visibility into non-compliant/maverick spend
- **Key Statistic:** Up to 80% of organizational spend can be maverick spend
- **Risks Identified:**
  - Rising Business Costs
  - Increased Procurement Costs
  - Contract Violations
  - Reputational Risk
  - Compliance & Legal Risk

### 2. General Approach to Maverick Spend Analysis
- Focus on visibility and control
- Dashboard-based analysis
- Drill-down capabilities by supplier categories
- Filter by non-approved spend
- Dynamic categorization capabilities

### 3. Search Results Insights
- Multiple tools and vendors offer maverick spend analysis
- Common focus on identifying off-contract purchases
- Emphasis on supplier concentration as a risk factor
- One LinkedIn article specifically mentioned HHI usage (but access restricted)

## Next Steps:
- Access supplier spend analysis guide
- Look for more specific information about concentration metrics
- Compare with the original dashboard implementation



## Detailed Findings from SCM Solution Guide:

### Step 4: Analyze the Data - Key Aspects Include:

1. **Supplier Concentration**: Identifying which suppliers are getting the largest share of your spend.
2. **Supplier Risk**: Assessing whether you are over-reliant on certain suppliers and considering the risk of supply chain disruption.
3. **Spend Distribution**: Understanding how your spending is distributed across categories, regions, or products.
4. **Price Variability**: Analyzing whether prices vary significantly for the same products or services from different suppliers.
5. **Savings Opportunities**: Identifying areas where renegotiating contracts or consolidating purchases could reduce costs.

### Step 5: Identify Opportunities for Improvement:

1. **Supplier Consolidation**: If you're spending small amounts with multiple suppliers, consider consolidating your supplier base.
2. **Negotiation Leverage**: Identify suppliers where you have high spending and could leverage this for better pricing or terms.
3. **Reducing Maverick Spend**: If you identify purchases made outside of contracted suppliers (maverick spend), take steps to redirect this spending back to preferred suppliers.
4. **Optimizing Payment Terms**: Reviewing payment terms with suppliers to ensure they align with your cash flow requirements.

## Key Insight:
The methodology described aligns with the HHI approach - focusing on identifying suppliers with the "largest share of spend" which is exactly what the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index measures through concentration analysis.
